The market is not excited about this Quip acquisition by $CRM.. $CRM is one of the biggest losers of the day. Behind $AAPL lots of #SELLING

$NVDA moving with the mrkt. no worries short term. still pumped though. 90% institutional ownership has this inflated.

$NVDA Today closes lower and the fear is starting to creep in after a historic run. See $AMBA
$NVDA Monday stock closes lower as the Manipulators sell short all the shares you&#39;re buying.
