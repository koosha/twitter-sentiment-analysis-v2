Bullish Trade Setups for a New Month | $ADBE $HA $GE $CAT $LVS &amp; more SharePlanner http://www.shareplanner.com/featured-blogs/ryan-mallory/trade-setups/22898-bullish-trade-setups-for-a-new-month.html
$ADBE feels like buyout or stock split is coming
$ADBE a close above $98 is very bullish &amp; goes to $100 psychological break thru &amp; we sit around there until earnings. $110 Dec very possible
$ADBE march past $98 starts again today. Gets to $100 quickly once it gets past $98. Giddy up!
$ADBE crap, what a disappointing fizzle at the close &amp; AH is down too. I guess a 5th time will be the charm &amp; get sellers out of the way!!
$ADBE busting through $98 finally so away we go! $110 by the end of the year.
$ADBE 3x it has met resistance @$98 so once it pushes past, onto $110 by December. Bye bye Flash hello new stuff
$N generates 73 cents in revenue for each $1 in assets vs 43 cents at $VMW http://bit.ly/2a6BI6A $CRM $ADBE
My trade for next week $AL 8/4, $JCP 8/12, $TA  8/4, $CTSH 8/5.
$HA, $CTSH, $PF, $JCP, $WYNN, $YHOO are my favorite stocks.
@Retro807 If that&#39;s how you feel, you should stop pumping $MU.
@Retro807 That&#39;s just mean, but I agree with your bullish assessment on $MU.  18+ near-term target. $MU
With oil crashing, time to move away from ad-based tech and into tech that makes something like $AAPL, $INTC, $NVDA and $MU.
$MU Completely agree with you @Retro807! Buyout by $AAPL or $INTC is imminent! 18+
